                        MetaMask is one of the most popular Ethereum non-custodial wallets, we're going to walk through how to set one up
                    </p>
                    <h3>Step #1: Downloading MetaMask</h3>
                    <p>To create a secure wallet, you should download the MetaMask browser extension from the official website <a href="https://metamask.io" class="link">https://metamask.io</a></p>
                    <p>This extension is supported by Chrome, Firefox, Brave, and Edge browsers. </p>
                    <img src="./img/faq/how-to-setup-metamask/1.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>Click on the "Download for ✨Your browser✨" button. This will take you to the Extensions store where you can download and add the extension to your browser.</p>
                    <img src="./img/faq/how-to-setup-metamask/2.jpg" alt="">
                    <h3>Step #2: Creating Your Account</h3>
                    <p>The next step is setting up your account</p>
                    <p>If this is your first time, after opening MetaMask, you'll most likely get a screen similar to the one below and you'll want to select "Create a Wallet".​</p>
                    <p>After doing so, you'll be asked to accept the terms of use and will then need to create a password (this password will be needed for logging into your wallet from time to time).</p>
                    <p>Then you will get your seed phrase. It is 12 words that could give you ability to restore access to your wallet</p>
                    <p>Congratulations! You setted up your Metamask!</p>
                    <p>Now it would be nice to fund your Metamask account with some BNB</p>
                    <h3>Step #3: Set up Binance Smart Chain on Metamask wallet</h3>
                    <p>Default chain for Metamask is Ethereum. To add Binance Chain click on Networks and Add Network</p>
                    <p>Then you could add chain from a list of popular networks. But we will do it manually. Click "Add a network manually" link under list</p>
