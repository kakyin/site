        <p class="description color-gray">
            Learn more about CapybaraCoin. whitepaper contains comprehensive information about buying a token and making a profit. You will also find there about tokenomics and plans for the further development of the project.
        </p>
        <h3>Get started</h3>
        <p>$CPBC CapybaraCoin is a token built on the Binance Smart Chain. It is a meme coin that is designed to be used as a medium of exchange and investment. The goal of the team is to convert the CPBC coin from a meme coin to a real, useful token with various use cases.</p>
        <h3>Tokenomics</h3>
        <h2>&nbsp &nbsp  Max Wallet</h2>
        <p>
            As an anti-dumping mechanism to prevent significant price manipulation by whales, we capped all wallets at 5%. The only exceptions are reserve, airdrop and burning accounts.
        </p>
        <h2>&nbsp &nbsp  Total Supply & Deflation</h2>
        <p>
            The initial total supply is 1,000,000 CPBC tokens. No LP tokens burned or locked, they will be used as a deflation mechanism according to the following system: in case of a dangerous depreciation, % of liquidity is withdrawn, from the withdrawn tokens, the CPBC is burned, and its pair goes to purchase the CPBC. the tokens received as a result of the purchase can be used for an airdrop or transferred to a reserve account.
        </p>
        <h2>&nbsp &nbsp  Minting</h2>
        <p>
            Minting of new tokens can be done to eliminate the shortage of supply. In other cases, minting is done to create amount of tokens that can be given to community in airdrops.
        </p>
        <h2>&nbsp &nbsp  Low liquidity</h2>
        <p>
            The $CPBC coin is a new cryptocurrency that offers low liquidity to maximize profit for its community. We believe that this will have a positive impact on the growth dynamics of the coin. By providing low liquidity, we are able to encourage more people to invest in the coin and help to grow the community.
        </p>
